# D20 Character Generation

## Hit Points

In Dungeons & Dragons (D&D), hit dice (HD) are rolled to determine how many hit points (HP) a character gains when they level up. The number and type of hit dice a character rolls depend on their class. Each class has a specific hit die size, which represents the character's health potential per level.

### General Rules for Rolling Hit Dice:

1. **Hit Die by Class**: Each class has a specific hit die (e.g., d6, d8, d10, or d12). Here are the hit dice for some common classes:
   - **Wizard**: d6
   - **Rogue**: d8
   - **Fighter**: d10
   - **Barbarian**: d12

2. **Rolling Hit Dice When Gaining a Level**:
   - When a character gains a level, they roll the hit die associated with their class and add the result to their current hit points.
   - **Constitution Modifier**: In addition to the roll, the character adds their **Constitution modifier** to the result of the hit die roll. If the modifier is positive, it increases the hit points gained; if negative, it reduces them.

3. **Example of Hit Dice Roll on Level Up**:
   - A **Fighter** (who uses a d10 for hit dice) with a Constitution modifier of +2 rolls a d10 when leveling up. If the result is 7, they add their Constitution modifier, gaining a total of 9 hit points (7 from the roll + 2 from Constitution modifier).

4. **At 1st Level**:
   - At the first level, instead of rolling, most editions of D&D allow characters to take the maximum value of their hit die (e.g., a Fighter would automatically get 10 HP plus their Constitution modifier at 1st level).

5. **Alternative Rule - Average Hit Points**:
   - Some groups use an alternative method where characters take an average roll instead of rolling the dice each time. For example, if a Fighter has a d10 hit die, they might take 5.5 (often rounded up to 6) + their Constitution modifier at each level.

### Healing Using Hit Dice:
In addition to leveling up, hit dice are also used to regain hit points during a **short rest** in some editions (e.g., D&D 5e). During a short rest, a character can roll one or more of their hit dice and add their Constitution modifier to regain hit points. The number of hit dice a character can roll is equal to their level, but once used, hit dice can only be regained after a **long rest**.

### Example Hit Dice by Class:
| Class     | Hit Die |
|-----------|---------|
| Barbarian | d12     |
| Cleric    | d8      |
| Fighter   | d10     |
| Paladin   | d10     |
| Rogue     | d8      |
| Wizard    | d6      |

In summary, characters roll their class's hit die when they gain a level to determine how many hit points they gain. The roll is modified by the character's Constitution modifier, and at 1st level, they typically start with the maximum possible roll.

What are the sequence of events that a player must go through to generate the hit points for a third level character? For concreteness, consider the character to be a fighter.

To generate the hit points for a 3rd-level fighter in Dungeons & Dragons, a player would follow these steps:

### 1. **Determine the Hit Points at 1st Level**
   - At 1st level, characters typically take the maximum value of their hit die.
   - The hit die for a fighter is **d10**.
   - The player adds their **Constitution modifier** to this value.

   **Example**:  
   - Fighter’s hit die: **d10**, so maximum HP at 1st level is **10**.
   - Let's assume the fighter has a **+2 Constitution modifier**.
   - Total hit points at 1st level: **10 (maximum hit die) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = 12 HP**.

### 2. **Roll Hit Dice for 2nd Level**
   - At 2nd level, the player rolls a **d10** for the fighter’s hit dice.
   - They add the **Constitution modifier** to the result of the roll.
   - Alternatively, some players or DMs allow taking the average value of the die instead of rolling (usually 5.5, rounded up to 6, for a d10).

   **Example**:
   - The player rolls a **d10** and gets a **7**.
   - Constitution modifier is **+2**.
   - Total HP gained at 2nd level: **7 (roll) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = 9 HP**.
   - Running total HP: **12 HP (from 1st level) + 9 HP (from 2nd level) = 21 HP**.

### 3. **Roll Hit Dice for 3rd Level**
   - At 3rd level, the player rolls another **d10** for the fighter’s hit dice.
   - As with the previous level, they add their **Constitution modifier** to the roll.

   **Example**:
   - The player rolls a **d10** and gets a **5**.
   - Constitution modifier is **+2**.
   - Total HP gained at 3rd level: **5 (roll) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = 7 HP**.
   - Running total HP: **21 HP (from 1st and 2nd levels) + 7 HP (from 3rd level) = 28 HP**.

### 4. **Final HP at 3rd Level**
   After following these steps, the fighter’s total hit points at 3rd level would be the sum of the HP gained at each level.

   **Final Total HP at 3rd Level**:
   - 1st Level HP: **12**
   - 2nd Level HP: **9**
   - 3rd Level HP: **7**
   - **Total HP at 3rd Level: 28 HP**

### Alternative: Taking Average Rolls
If the DM allows taking the average of the dice rolls rather than rolling them manually, the player would take **6** (the average of a d10) each time they level up. The calculation for the fighter’s hit points at 3rd level would look like this:

   **Example (Using Average Rolls)**:
   - 1st Level: 10 (max) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = **12 HP**.
   - 2nd Level: 6 (average roll) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = **8 HP**.
   - 3rd Level: 6 (average roll) + 2 (Constitution modifier) = **8 HP**.
   - **Total HP at 3rd Level: 28 HP** (same as the rolled example, though this may vary).

### Summary of Sequence for a Fighter at 3rd Level:
1. **1st Level**: Take max hit die (d10), add Constitution modifier.
2. **2nd Level**: Roll a d10, add Constitution modifier.
3. **3rd Level**: Roll another d10, add Constitution modifier.
4. **Final HP**: Sum the results from all three levels.

This process ensures that a character’s hit points scale with their level and Constitution modifier.

For a wizard with a low Constitution modifier, the process for determining hit points at 3rd level follows the same basic structure as for a fighter, but with important differences due to the wizard’s hit die size (d6) and the low Constitution modifier.

Let’s assume the wizard has a **-1 Constitution modifier** to illustrate how this affects their hit points at each level.

### Steps to Generate Hit Points for a 3rd-Level Wizard:

### 1. **Determine Hit Points at 1st Level**
   - At 1st level, characters take the maximum value of their hit die.
   - The hit die for a wizard is **d6**.
   - The player adds their **Constitution modifier** to this value. In this case, the Constitution modifier is **-1**.

   **Example**:
   - Wizard’s hit die: **d6**, so maximum HP at 1st level is **6**.
   - Constitution modifier is **-1**.
   - Total hit points at 1st level: **6 (maximum hit die) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = 5 HP**.

### 2. **Roll Hit Dice for 2nd Level**
   - At 2nd level, the player rolls a **d6** for the wizard’s hit dice.
   - They add the **Constitution modifier** to the result of the roll.
   - Alternatively, they may take the average value of the die (3.5, rounded up to 4 for a d6).

   **Example**:
   - The player rolls a **d6** and gets a **4**.
   - Constitution modifier is **-1**.
   - Total HP gained at 2nd level: **4 (roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = 3 HP**.
   - Running total HP: **5 HP (from 1st level) + 3 HP (from 2nd level) = 8 HP**.

### 3. **Roll Hit Dice for 3rd Level**
   - At 3rd level, the player rolls another **d6** for the wizard’s hit dice.
   - As with the previous level, they add their **Constitution modifier** to the roll.

   **Example**:
   - The player rolls a **d6** and gets a **2**.
   - Constitution modifier is **-1**.
   - Total HP gained at 3rd level: **2 (roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = 1 HP**.
   - Running total HP: **8 HP (from 1st and 2nd levels) + 1 HP (from 3rd level) = 9 HP**.

### 4. **Final HP at 3rd Level**
   After following these steps, the wizard’s total hit points at 3rd level would be the sum of the HP gained at each level.

   **Final Total HP at 3rd Level**:
   - 1st Level HP: **5**
   - 2nd Level HP: **3**
   - 3rd Level HP: **1**
   - **Total HP at 3rd Level: 9 HP**

### Alternative: Taking Average Rolls
If the DM allows taking the average roll for hit points instead of rolling manually, the player would take **4** (average of a d6) each time they level up, then add the Constitution modifier.

   **Example (Using Average Rolls)**:
   - 1st Level: 6 (max) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **5 HP**.
   - 2nd Level: 4 (average roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **3 HP**.
   - 3rd Level: 4 (average roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **3 HP**.
   - **Total HP at 3rd Level: 5 HP (1st level) + 3 HP (2nd level) + 3 HP (3rd level) = 11 HP**.

### Summary of Sequence for a Wizard at 3rd Level:
1. **1st Level**: Take max hit die (d6), add Constitution modifier.
2. **2nd Level**: Roll a d6, add Constitution modifier.
3. **3rd Level**: Roll another d6, add Constitution modifier.
4. **Final HP**: Sum the results from all three levels.

### Example: Low-Constitution Wizard with -1 Modifier
- **1st Level**: 6 (max for d6) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **5 HP**.
- **2nd Level**: 4 (roll or average) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **3 HP**.
- **3rd Level**: 2 (roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = **1 HP**.

- **Total HP at 3rd Level: 9 HP** (or 11 HP if taking average rolls).

What happens with this wizard if one of the rolls is 1?

If one of the hit dice rolls is a **1** for a wizard with a low Constitution modifier (like **-1**), it can have a significant impact on the character's hit points. Let's walk through what would happen.

### Steps with a Roll of 1 at 2nd or 3rd Level:

1. **1st Level**: As usual, the wizard starts with the maximum hit points for their class (d6 hit die), which is 6. The Constitution modifier is applied afterward.
   
   - **Max roll** at 1st level: **6**.
   - Constitution modifier: **-1**.
   - **Total HP at 1st level**: **6 - 1 = 5 HP**.

2. **2nd Level (Roll a 1)**: 
   - The wizard rolls a **1** on their d6 hit die.
   - Constitution modifier is **-1**.
   - The total HP gained from leveling up is **1 (roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = 0 HP**.

   So, at 2nd level, this wizard would not gain any hit points and stay at **5 HP**.

3. **3rd Level**:
   - The player rolls for HP again. Let’s assume they roll a **4** this time.
   - Constitution modifier is **-1**.
   - The total HP gained at 3rd level is **4 (roll) - 1 (Constitution modifier) = 3 HP**.
   - Adding this to the previous total (which is still 5 HP from 1st level), the total HP at 3rd level is **5 HP (from 1st level) + 3 HP (from 3rd level) = 8 HP**.

### Final HP if One Roll is 1:
If the wizard rolls a **1** at 2nd level, with a **-1 Constitution modifier**, they would gain **0 HP** at 2nd level, leaving them with **5 HP** from 1st level. After the roll for 3rd level (assuming a higher roll like 4), they would end up with **8 HP** at 3rd level.

### Important Points:
- **Rolling a 1 with a negative Constitution modifier** can result in **0 hit points** gained for that level. This does **not reduce the character’s current hit points** but means they don’t gain any new hit points when they level up.
- Many DMs implement a **"minimum 1 HP rule"**, ensuring that a character always gains at least 1 HP when leveling up, regardless of low rolls or negative modifiers. If this rule is in effect, the wizard would gain **1 HP** instead of 0, even with a negative modifier.

### Example With "Minimum 1 HP Rule":
- **2nd Level (Roll of 1)**: If the DM uses this rule, the wizard would gain **1 HP**, even though the roll and modifier would otherwise result in 0.
   - Total HP after 2nd level: **5 HP (1st level) + 1 HP (2nd level) = 6 HP**.
- **3rd Level**: As before, the wizard rolls a **4** and adds their Constitution modifier of **-1**, gaining **3 HP**.
   - Total HP after 3rd level: **6 HP (from 2nd level) + 3 HP = 9 HP**.

### Summary of What Happens When Rolling a 1:
- **Without the "minimum 1 HP rule"**: A roll of 1 with a **-1 Constitution modifier** results in **0 HP gained** for that level.
- **With the "minimum 1 HP rule"**: The wizard would gain at least **1 HP**, even with a low roll and a negative Constitution modifier.

Thus, rolling a **1** with a negative Constitution modifier can severely limit a character's hit point progression, but common house rules like "minimum 1 HP" can help prevent characters from stagnating too much.
