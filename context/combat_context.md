# Explain the d20 game system. Focus on 3.5 edition.

The **d20 System** is a role-playing game system that was introduced by Wizards of the Coast in 2000, coinciding with the release of *Dungeons & Dragons* 3rd Edition (D&D 3e). The d20 System serves as a standardized set of mechanics used across multiple role-playing games (RPGs), and it derives its name from the use of the 20-sided die (d20) as a core element for task resolution.

**Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition (D&D 3.5e)**, released in 2003, is an updated and refined version of 3rd Edition and is one of the most popular iterations of the d20 System. Let's break down the key aspects of the d20 System as presented in D&D 3.5e:

### Core Mechanics

1. **d20 Rolls**: The core mechanic revolves around rolling a 20-sided die (d20) to determine the outcome of actions, such as attacking, skill checks, and saving throws. The result of the d20 roll is modified by various bonuses (or penalties) to produce a final result. The goal is to meet or exceed a target number, such as an Armor Class (AC) for attacks or a Difficulty Class (DC) for skill checks and saving throws.

2. **Ability Scores**: Characters have six primary ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each ranging from 3 to 18 (or higher for exceptional characters). These scores determine the modifiers that are added to d20 rolls. For example, a Strength score of 18 gives a +4 modifier.

3. **Modifiers and Bonuses**:
   - **Ability Modifiers**: Derived from ability scores, ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +5 or higher.
   - **Skill Ranks**: Each character gains a number of skill points per level, which can be allocated to various skills to increase their effectiveness.
   - **Base Attack Bonus (BAB)**: Represents a character’s combat proficiency. Higher BAB means better chances to hit enemies in combat.
   - **Saving Throws**: Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saving throws represent a character's ability to resist various effects (such as spells, poison, or traps). Each is associated with specific ability modifiers: Reflex (Dexterity), Fortitude (Constitution), and Will (Wisdom).

4. **Combat System**:
   - Combat is typically broken down into rounds, with each round representing 6 seconds of in-game time.
   - Actions in combat are categorized as standard actions (like attacking), move actions (like moving your speed), full-round actions (like making multiple attacks), free actions (like talking), swift actions, and immediate actions.
   - Initiative determines the order of turns in combat and is rolled with a d20 plus a character's Dexterity modifier.

### Character Creation and Progression

1. **Character Classes**: D&D 3.5e features a wide array of classes, such as Fighter, Rogue, Wizard, Cleric, and more, each with its own set of abilities, skills, and progression paths. Each class has a distinct role, such as frontline combat, spellcasting, or stealth.

2. **Leveling Up**: Characters gain experience points (XP) for overcoming challenges, which allow them to level up. Each level gained provides benefits like increased hit points, better attack bonuses, new class features, and additional skill points.

3. **Feats**: Characters gain feats at various levels, which provide special abilities or enhancements, such as increased weapon proficiency, special combat maneuvers, or enhanced spellcasting.

4. **Skills**: Skills represent a character's ability to perform various tasks, such as climbing, stealth, or deciphering languages. Characters allocate skill points based on their class and Intelligence modifier.

### Magic System

1. **Spells and Spellcasting**: Spellcasters, such as Wizards, Clerics, and Sorcerers, cast spells using a system of spell slots, prepared spells (for Wizards and Clerics), or spontaneous casting (for Sorcerers and Bards). Spells are categorized by level (0-9), and more powerful spells consume higher-level spell slots.

2. **Saving Throws vs. Spells**: Many spells require targets to make saving throws (Reflex, Fortitude, or Will) to resist their effects or reduce damage. The DC for a saving throw against a spell is typically 10 + spell level + the caster's relevant ability modifier.

### Game Master (GM) Role

1. **Adjudication**: The Game Master (GM) serves as the storyteller and referee, describing the world, controlling non-player characters (NPCs), and adjudicating the rules. The GM decides the outcomes of player actions based on rules, d20 rolls, and narrative.

2. **Encounters**: The GM designs encounters—combat, social, or environmental challenges—for players to face. The challenge rating (CR) system helps the GM balance encounters to be appropriate for the party's level.

### Customization and Flexibility

1. **Multiclassing**: Characters can take levels in multiple classes, allowing for hybrid abilities and unique builds. A Fighter/Wizard or Rogue/Cleric combination can create versatile characters.

2. **Prestige Classes**: Special classes that characters can qualify for by meeting specific prerequisites, offering powerful and unique abilities beyond those of standard classes.

3. **Optional Rules and Variants**: D&D 3.5e provides many optional rules and variants that can be used to tailor the game experience, including alternate rules for combat, skills, magic, and character abilities.

### Conclusion

The d20 system, especially as implemented in D&D 3.5e, is known for its versatility, depth, and balance between structured rules and creative freedom. The combination of d20 rolls, modifiers, skills, feats, and the flexibility of character creation and advancement provides a robust framework for storytelling and gameplay, allowing for a wide range of adventures and player experiences.

# Explain the combat system in D20.

The combat system in the d20 system, particularly in **Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition (D&D 3.5e)**, is a structured framework that uses a turn-based approach to resolve combat encounters. The system involves rolling a 20-sided die (d20) to determine the outcomes of actions like attacking, defending, and executing special maneuvers. Here’s an in-depth breakdown of how the combat system works:

### 1. **Combat Sequence and Structure**

Combat in the d20 system is divided into **rounds**, with each round representing **6 seconds** of in-game time. A round consists of several **turns**, one for each participant in the combat. The sequence of turns is determined by **initiative**.

#### a. **Initiative**
- At the beginning of combat, each participant rolls a d20 and adds their **Dexterity modifier** and any other initiative bonuses. The result determines the order in which characters and creatures act.
- Initiative is rolled once at the start of combat and remains the same throughout unless affected by spells, abilities, or conditions that change it.

#### b. **Combat Rounds and Turns**
- During a round, each participant takes a **turn** in the order determined by initiative. A turn involves a set of actions that a character can perform.

### 2. **Types of Actions**

On their turn, a character can perform a combination of different types of actions:

#### a. **Standard Actions**
- A **Standard Action** is the most common type of action and includes making a single melee or ranged attack, casting a spell, using a special ability, or other specific actions. 
- Some standard actions can be combined with a move action (e.g., moving and attacking in the same turn).

#### b. **Move Actions**
- A **Move Action** allows a character to move up to their **speed** (typically 30 feet for most humans). 
- Move actions can also be used for activities like drawing a weapon, standing up from prone, or opening a door.

#### c. **Full-Round Actions**
- A **Full-Round Action** takes up a character's entire turn. It typically involves more complex maneuvers, like making a **full attack** (which allows a character to make multiple attacks if they have a high **Base Attack Bonus**), running, or using certain special abilities.
  
#### d. **Free Actions**
- **Free Actions** take minimal time and effort and can be performed alongside other actions. Examples include speaking, dropping an item, or certain class abilities.
  
#### e. **Swift and Immediate Actions**
- **Swift Actions** take a small amount of time and are limited to one per round, such as some spells and class abilities.
- **Immediate Actions** are similar but can be performed outside of a character's turn (e.g., a spell that allows for an instant response to an opponent's action).

### 3. **Attacks and Damage**

#### a. **Attack Rolls**
- When making an attack (melee or ranged), a character rolls a d20 and adds their **Base Attack Bonus (BAB)**, along with relevant ability modifiers (Strength for melee, Dexterity for ranged) and other modifiers (feats, magic items, situational modifiers).
- The result is compared to the target's **Armor Class (AC)**. If the result equals or exceeds the target’s AC, the attack hits.

#### b. **Damage Rolls**
- If an attack hits, the attacker rolls the appropriate dice for their weapon or attack (e.g., 1d8 for a longsword) and adds relevant modifiers (usually Strength for melee weapons, or Dexterity for ranged weapons if the attacker has the Weapon Finesse feat).
- Damage is subtracted from the target's **Hit Points (HP)**. When a character's HP reaches 0 or below, they fall unconscious or die.

#### c. **Critical Hits**
- If the d20 roll is within a weapon's **critical threat range** (usually a natural 20, but sometimes broader like 19-20 for some weapons), a critical threat is confirmed by rolling another attack roll. If this second roll also hits, the attack is a **critical hit**, and damage is multiplied (usually by 2 or more, depending on the weapon).

### 4. **Combat Modifiers**

Several modifiers can affect attack rolls and damage:

- **Flanking**: If a character and their ally are on opposite sides of an enemy, they are considered to be flanking, providing a +2 bonus to attack rolls.
- **Cover and Concealment**: Enemies behind cover gain a bonus to their AC, and those with concealment may force attackers to roll a miss chance.
- **Power Attack and Combat Expertise**: These feats allow characters to trade attack bonuses for extra damage or AC, respectively.

### 5. **Armor Class (AC)**

- **Armor Class (AC)** represents how difficult a character is to hit in combat. It is calculated using the formula:  
  **AC = 10 + Armor Bonus + Shield Bonus + Dexterity Modifier + Size Modifier + Miscellaneous Modifiers**.
- Higher AC means it's more challenging for enemies to land a successful hit.

### 6. **Special Combat Actions**

Several special maneuvers can be attempted in combat, each with its own rules:

- **Grapple**: A character can attempt to grapple an opponent, which involves a series of opposed checks and can lead to restraining or moving the opponent.
- **Disarm**: Attempting to knock a weapon out of an opponent's hands.
- **Trip**: Trying to knock an opponent to the ground; usually involves an opposed Strength or Dexterity check.
- **Bull Rush**: Attempting to push an opponent back.

### 7. **Saving Throws**

- **Saving Throws** represent a character's ability to resist various harmful effects. There are three types:
  - **Fortitude Saves**: Based on Constitution, these resist physical effects like poison and disease.
  - **Reflex Saves**: Based on Dexterity, these help avoid damage from area effects like explosions.
  - **Will Saves**: Based on Wisdom, these resist mental or magical effects like charm or fear.

### 8. **Conditions and Status Effects**

Characters can be affected by various **conditions** that influence their combat abilities, such as:

- **Stunned**: Unable to act, loses Dexterity bonus to AC.
- **Prone**: Grants bonuses to melee attackers but provides penalties against ranged attacks.
- **Blinded, Paralyzed, Frightened, etc.**: Each condition comes with specific penalties and effects.

### 9. **Death and Dying**

- Characters reduced to **0 HP** are considered **disabled**.
- Characters reduced to **-1 to -9 HP** are **dying** and must make a **Stabilization check** each round to avoid further HP loss.
- At **-10 HP**, a character dies.

### 10. **Combat Example**

1. A Fighter with a Base Attack Bonus (BAB) of +5, Strength modifier of +3, and a longsword (+3 to attack and 1d8+3 damage) attacks an Orc with an AC of 15.
2. The Fighter rolls a d20 and gets a 12. Adding the BAB (+5) and Strength modifier (+3) results in a total of 20.
3. The attack hits because 20 > 15 (the Orc's AC).
4. The Fighter rolls 1d8 for damage and adds +3 for Strength, dealing, for example, 6 points of damage.
5. The Orc’s HP is reduced by 6. If it falls to 0 or lower, the Orc is defeated.

### Conclusion

The d20 combat system is a comprehensive and flexible framework that provides a wide range of options for tactical play. It combines strategic choices with random elements, making combat dynamic and engaging. If you need more details on specific maneuvers or rules, feel free to ask!

# Example combat scenario

Starting with rolling initiative, how might combat proceed with two sides, the first a party of fighter, cleric, rogue and mage, and the second a force of three goblins and a bugbear. Assume that the rogue attempts to enter the room silently and hide, and that the rest of the party enters a round later. It is possible that the goblins will be concealed at the time the rogue enters, but the bugbear will be in plain sight.

In this example, we’ll outline the flow of combat from the moment initiative is rolled, detailing each round’s actions for both sides. This scenario involves a party of four (Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Mage) against a force of three Goblins and a Bugbear. The Rogue attempts to stealthily enter the room first, while the rest of the party follows in the next round. The Goblins are potentially hidden, but the Bugbear is in plain sight.

### Pre-Combat Setup

- **Party Members:**
  - **Rogue**: High Dexterity, focuses on stealth and sneak attacks.
  - **Fighter**: High Strength, melee-focused, high hit points.
  - **Cleric**: Balanced, capable of melee and healing, wearing medium or heavy armor.
  - **Mage**: High Intelligence, low hit points, casting spells from range.

- **Enemies:**
  - **Goblins (3)**: Low hit points, nimble, likely to hide or use ranged attacks.
  - **Bugbear**: Strong melee combatant, high hit points, but visible at the start.

### Step-by-Step Combat Breakdown

#### **Surprise Round: Rogue Attempts to Enter Stealthily**

1. **Rogue’s Approach and Stealth Check:**
   - The Rogue attempts to enter the room silently. The player rolls a **Move Silently** check (d20 + Dexterity modifier + ranks in Move Silently + any other bonuses).
   - If the Goblins are **concealed** (hidden behind cover), they will roll **Listen checks** (d20 + Wisdom modifier + ranks in Listen) to detect the Rogue. If they succeed, the Rogue's stealth is compromised; otherwise, the Rogue remains undetected.
   - The Bugbear, being in plain sight, also makes a **Listen check** to detect the Rogue.

2. **Rogue’s Hide Check:**
   - If the Rogue succeeds on the **Move Silently** check, they may attempt a **Hide check** (d20 + Dexterity modifier + ranks in Hide + any bonuses). This roll is contested by the **Spot checks** (d20 + Wisdom modifier + ranks in Spot) of the Goblins and the Bugbear. The result determines if the Rogue remains hidden.

3. **Outcome of Stealth Attempts:**
   - If the Rogue successfully **hides** without being detected by either the Goblins or the Bugbear, they gain an advantageous position for a sneak attack.
   - If the Rogue fails either the **Move Silently** or **Hide check**, the Bugbear and any Goblins who detect the Rogue will react, potentially initiating combat.

#### **Round 1: Initiative Roll and Rogue’s Action**

1. **Initiative Rolls:**
   - All characters (both PCs and NPCs) roll for **Initiative** (d20 + Dexterity modifier + any bonuses). The order of turns is determined based on these results.
   - Suppose the initiative order ends up being: **Rogue > Goblin 1 > Bugbear > Cleric > Fighter > Mage > Goblin 2 > Goblin 3**.

2. **Rogue’s Turn:**
   - Since the Rogue was already hidden and won the initiative, they might decide to **attack from hiding**, gaining a **Sneak Attack** bonus if they remain undetected. The Rogue makes a **ranged attack** (e.g., with a shortbow) or a **melee attack** (if close enough).
   - The attack roll is made against the Bugbear's **AC** (if chosen as the target). If the attack hits, the Rogue rolls for damage and adds **Sneak Attack** damage because the Bugbear is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC due to being unaware of the Rogue’s presence.

3. **Goblin 1’s Turn:**
   - If Goblin 1 sees the Rogue or was alerted, it can attack or move to a defensive position. If hidden, the Goblin may choose to shoot with a shortbow, move into melee, or stay hidden.

4. **Bugbear’s Turn:**
   - The Bugbear, if not surprised, moves towards the Rogue or readies an action to attack when the rest of the party arrives.

#### **Round 2: Rest of the Party Enters**

1. **Cleric’s Turn:**
   - The Cleric enters the room. If they notice the Bugbear, they may choose to **cast a buff spell** (e.g., **Bless** to boost allies’ attack rolls) or prepare a defensive stance.

2. **Fighter’s Turn:**
   - The Fighter follows in, closing the gap to engage in melee with the Bugbear. The Fighter can make a **melee attack** (d20 + Base Attack Bonus + Strength modifier + any other bonuses vs. Bugbear's AC).

3. **Mage’s Turn:**
   - The Mage enters last, keeping distance. Depending on the situation, the Mage might cast a **spell** like **Magic Missile** (automatic hit for small damage) or **Sleep** (potentially incapacitating the Goblins if their Hit Dice are low enough).

4. **Goblin 2 and 3’s Turns:**
   - Depending on their positions, these Goblins may use **ranged attacks** (e.g., shortbows) or move to engage in melee. If hidden, they might attempt to shoot while maintaining cover.

#### **Round 3: Ongoing Combat**

1. **Rogue’s Turn (Again):**
   - The Rogue can **move** into a flanking position with the Fighter against the Bugbear or make another ranged attack from a different position.

2. **Goblin 1’s Turn:**
   - Goblin 1 might continue attacking with a ranged weapon or move into melee range to assist the Bugbear.

3. **Bugbear’s Turn:**
   - The Bugbear is likely to focus on the most threatening character, probably the Fighter. It makes a **full attack** action if in melee range, potentially dealing significant damage due to its higher damage output.

4. **Cleric’s Turn:**
   - The Cleric might choose to cast a **healing spell** (like **Cure Light Wounds**) on the Fighter if they’ve taken significant damage or cast **Hold Person** on the Bugbear if they’re in a dire situation.

5. **Fighter’s Turn:**
   - The Fighter continues engaging the Bugbear in melee combat, using abilities like **Power Attack** to trade attack bonuses for extra damage if the Bugbear is a high-priority target.

6. **Mage’s Turn:**
   - The Mage could cast a **crowd control spell** like **Grease** to trip up the Goblins or a direct damage spell like **Burning Hands** if the enemies are clustered.

7. **Goblin 2 and 3’s Turns:**
   - The remaining Goblins could flank, use hit-and-run tactics, or withdraw to regroup. If threatened, they might attempt a **withdrawal action** to avoid opportunity attacks and reposition.

#### **Subsequent Rounds: Combat Resolution**

Combat continues with each participant taking turns in order of initiative. The outcome depends on tactics, dice rolls, and strategic decisions:

- **Rogue** will try to exploit **Sneak Attack** opportunities by flanking or hiding.
- **Fighter** will continue as the primary melee tank, drawing attention and soaking damage.
- **Cleric** will balance between healing, buffing, and crowd control.
- **Mage** will focus on crowd control, debuffs, or targeted damage spells.
- **Goblins** might try to focus on weaker targets like the Mage or Cleric or continue guerrilla-style tactics.
- **Bugbear** will remain a significant threat due to its high damage potential and target the most immediate threats.

### Conclusion

This example illustrates how a combat scenario might unfold in the d20 system of D&D 3.5e. The turns are dictated by initiative, and each character or creature's actions are governed by their abilities, tactical decisions, and the results of dice rolls. The dynamic nature of the combat system allows for strategic depth, with positioning, spell usage, and teamwork playing crucial roles in the outcome of battles.

# What information must the DM track during combat to make the game run smoothly?

During combat in a d20 system game like **Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition**, the **Dungeon Master (DM)** must track a variety of information to ensure the game runs smoothly and fairly. Properly managing these details helps maintain the flow of combat, provides clarity for players, and ensures that the rules are followed. Here is a breakdown of the key information the DM should track:

### 1. **Initiative Order**

- **Initiative Rolls and Order**: Track the initiative rolls for all players and NPCs (non-player characters), including enemies. This order determines the sequence in which turns are taken during each round of combat. It can be helpful to write this down in a visible place or use initiative trackers to avoid confusion.
- **Delays and Readied Actions**: If a player delays their turn or readies an action, adjust their place in the initiative order accordingly. Note what conditions trigger readied actions to ensure they occur at the right time.

### 2. **Combatant Statistics**

For each participant in the combat (both PCs and NPCs), the DM should track:

- **Hit Points (HP)**: Track current and maximum HP for each character and enemy. Adjust HP as damage is taken or healing is applied. Consider using a spreadsheet or combat tracker to keep it organized.
- **Armor Class (AC)**: Keep track of the AC for each combatant, including any temporary bonuses or penalties due to spells, abilities, or conditions (e.g., being prone, cover, etc.).
- **Saving Throws**: Know the Reflex, Fortitude, and Will saving throw modifiers for each combatant, especially for resolving spell effects or abilities.
- **Base Attack Bonus (BAB) and Modifiers**: Track the attack bonuses for each combatant, including melee, ranged, and special attacks. Include modifiers from strength, dexterity, magic, or temporary effects.
- **Special Defenses**: Record any special resistances, immunities, or vulnerabilities for NPCs (e.g., resistance to fire, immunity to poison, vulnerability to cold).

### 3. **Conditions and Status Effects**

- **Tracking Conditions**: Track any ongoing conditions affecting combatants, such as **blinded, stunned, grappled, prone, poisoned**, or **fatigued**. Record when these conditions begin and end, as some may last for a certain number of rounds.
- **Effects of Spells and Abilities**: Track the duration and effects of ongoing spells, magical effects, and abilities. For example, **Bless** lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds), while **Hold Person** may last several rounds depending on concentration and saving throws.
- **Duration and Round Count**: For spells, abilities, or conditions with limited durations, keep track of how many rounds have passed and when each effect ends.

### 4. **Resources and Consumables**

- **Spell Slots and Spell Points**: Track how many spell slots have been used by spellcasting characters and NPCs. This includes tracking prepared spells for classes like Wizards and available spell slots for spontaneous casters like Sorcerers.
- **Ammunition and Consumables**: Track the use of consumable items like **arrows, bolts, potions, scrolls, wands,** or other limited-use items. Ensure players and NPCs are keeping accurate records.
- **Daily and Encounter Abilities**: Track abilities or powers that have limited uses per day or per encounter (e.g., **Turn Undead, Rage, Smite Evil,** or a **Bugbear's Surprise Attack** ability).

### 5. **Positioning and Movement**

- **Battlefield Positioning**: Track the positions of all combatants on the battlefield. This can be done using a physical grid map, virtual tabletop (VTT), or theater of the mind. Accurate positioning is crucial for determining range, movement, line of sight, area of effect, and whether characters are flanking.
- **Cover and Concealment**: Note any terrain features that provide cover or concealment, such as walls, pillars, fog, or darkness. Determine the appropriate bonuses or penalties for combatants benefiting from these features.

### 6. **Combat Actions and Options**

- **Declared Actions and Reactions**: Track the declared actions of each combatant during their turn, including **standard actions, move actions, free actions, swift actions,** and **full-round actions**.
- **Readied Actions and Delayed Actions**: Keep a note of any readied actions or delayed actions, along with the conditions that trigger them. Ensure these are resolved in the correct order.
- **Attacks of Opportunity**: Keep track of any attacks of opportunity that might occur due to movement, spellcasting, or other actions within the threatened area of an opponent. 

### 7. **Enemy AI and Tactics**

- **Enemy Behavior and Strategy**: Determine and track the behavior and tactics of enemies, such as whether they are aggressive, defensive, or strategic in their attacks. Plan out the next few actions for more complex enemies or when running multiple NPCs.
- **Morale and Retreat Conditions**: Decide when enemies may flee, surrender, or use alternate tactics based on the combat situation, remaining hit points, or other factors. Track conditions that might cause enemies to retreat or give up.

### 8. **Time Management**

- **Round Count**: Track the number of rounds that have passed in combat. This is crucial for keeping track of effects with limited durations (e.g., buffs, debuffs, conditions).
- **Concentration and Interruptions**: Keep track of spells or effects requiring concentration, and ensure players and NPCs make appropriate checks if they take damage or are otherwise distracted.

### 9. **Communicating Information**

- **Describe Actions and Outcomes**: Clearly describe the results of attacks, spells, and actions to the players. This includes whether attacks hit or miss, damage dealt, and the effects of spells or conditions. Effective communication enhances immersion and ensures players understand what’s happening.
- **Rules Adjudication**: Be prepared to make quick rules adjudications or clarifications as needed. Have reference materials like the Player’s Handbook, Dungeon Master’s Guide, and Monster Manual ready for quick lookup.

### 10. **Tracking Loot and Experience**

- **Dropped Items and Loot**: Note any items, treasure, or loot that enemies drop or have on them. Keep track of what players collect after combat.
- **Experience Points (XP)**: Keep a tally of the experience points awarded for defeating enemies, completing objectives, or achieving milestones. Allocate XP as needed to keep the game balanced.

### Conclusion

The DM's role in tracking all this information is crucial for a smooth and engaging combat experience. Keeping organized notes, using digital tools or apps designed for DMs, or even using simple tools like index cards or a whiteboard can make the process more manageable. The goal is to ensure that combat is fair, fun, and dynamic while keeping the game moving at a reasonable pace.
