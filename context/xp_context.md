In **Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition (D&D 3.5e)**, the rules for computing **experience points (XP)** revolve around rewarding players for overcoming challenges, primarily through combat, but also for completing story objectives, solving puzzles, and achieving other in-game goals. Here's a breakdown of the key rules and processes for computing XP:

### 1. **Experience Points (XP) Overview**
- **XP represents a measure of a character’s progress** in the game, and gaining XP allows a character to advance in levels. Higher levels grant more hit points, new class abilities, skill points, and feats.
- XP is awarded based on **defeating enemies**, **completing quests**, and sometimes **roleplaying**, **puzzles**, or **clever problem-solving**.

### 2. **Encounter-Based XP**
   - The main method of earning XP is through defeating monsters and enemies. Each monster or NPC has a **Challenge Rating (CR)**, which is used to determine how much XP the party earns for overcoming it.
   - The **Challenge Rating (CR)** reflects how difficult an encounter is for a typical party of four characters of a given level.

### 3. **Experience Award Table**
   - The amount of XP awarded for defeating a monster is based on comparing its CR to the **Average Party Level (APL)**.
   - The **XP Award Table** (found in the Dungeon Master's Guide) provides specific XP values depending on the level difference between the monster’s CR and the party’s level.
   - **Example**: A CR 5 monster defeated by a party of 4th-level characters would yield a certain amount of XP based on the table.

### 4. **Dividing XP Among the Party**
   - The total XP for a given encounter is **divided equally** among all characters who participated in the encounter.
   - For example, if an encounter yields 1,200 XP, and there are four characters in the party, each character would receive 300 XP.

### 5. **XP for Different Party Levels**
   - If the characters in the party are of **different levels**, XP is divided according to the guidelines for **Unequal Party Levels**.
   - Characters **at lower levels** receive **more XP** than higher-level characters from the same encounter, since they need more experience to catch up.

### 6. **Non-Combat XP**
   - While combat is the primary way to earn XP, the Dungeon Master can also award XP for:
     - **Completing story objectives**: For example, solving a mystery or negotiating a treaty.
     - **Roleplaying**: Engaging in significant character interactions or advancing the plot through roleplay.
     - **Solving puzzles** or **clever strategies**: Non-combat challenges can also be rewarded with XP at the DM’s discretion.

### 7. **Milestone and Story-Based XP**
   - Instead of calculating XP for every encounter, some Dungeon Masters use **milestone XP**, where XP is awarded for reaching certain narrative points in the story, bypassing the need for encounter-by-encounter calculation.

### 8. **Level Advancement**
   - When a character accumulates enough XP to reach the next level, they **immediately level up**, gaining new abilities according to their class progression.
   - The required XP to reach each level is determined by the **Character Advancement Table** in the Player’s Handbook.

### 9. **XP Penalties**
   - If a character has **too many classes** (more than one class without appropriate balancing between them), they may suffer an **XP penalty** (usually -20% to earned XP). This rule prevents characters from becoming too powerful by multiclassing excessively.
   - Additionally, if characters engage in **actions contrary to the party or campaign** (such as betrayal), a DM may impose **XP penalties** as a narrative or disciplinary consequence.

### 10. **Awarding XP for Defeating Monsters**
   - The Dungeon Master uses the following process to calculate the XP earned from combat:
     1. **Determine the Monster’s CR**.
     2. **Consult the XP Award Table** to find the base XP for the monster’s CR compared to the party’s level.
     3. **Adjust XP if necessary** based on the number of characters, their levels, or other difficulty-modifying factors.
     4. **Divide the XP equally** among party members.

### Summary of the Process
1. The DM evaluates the **CR of the encounter**.
2. XP is determined based on the **party’s average level**.
3. The total XP is **divided** among the characters.
4. XP can also be awarded for **non-combat accomplishments** or **milestones** at the DM’s discretion.

This system ensures that characters gradually become more powerful as they face and overcome greater challenges, while also allowing the DM flexibility in rewarding creativity and roleplaying.

## Examples

Let's go through an example of how a Dungeon Master (DM) would calculate **Experience Points (XP)** for a party of four 3rd-level characters (a Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard) after they defeat a small group of goblins.

### Step 1: Determine the Encounter's Challenge Rating (CR)

First, the DM needs to determine the **Challenge Rating (CR)** of the enemies in the encounter. In this case, let's assume the party fought **4 goblins**. According to the *Monster Manual*:

- Each **goblin** has a Challenge Rating of **CR 1/4**.

### Step 2: Use the XP Award Table to Find XP per Monster

Next, the DM consults the **XP Award Table** (found in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*) to determine how much XP each goblin is worth based on its CR and the party's level.

- The party members are all **3rd level**, and the goblins have a CR of **1/4**.

The XP Award Table for a **CR 1/4** monster for a **3rd-level** party indicates that each goblin is worth **75 XP**.

### Step 3: Multiply XP by the Number of Monsters

The DM then multiplies the XP value for a single goblin by the total number of goblins defeated:

- **75 XP per goblin** × **4 goblins** = **300 XP total** for the encounter.

### Step 4: Divide XP Equally Among Party Members

The next step is to divide the total XP earned from the encounter equally among all party members. Since the party has 4 characters (Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard), the DM divides the total XP as follows:

- **300 XP total** ÷ **4 party members** = **75 XP per character**.

Each party member receives **75 XP** from the encounter.

### Step 5: (Optional) Adjust for Difficulty or Special Circumstances

If the DM feels that the encounter was especially challenging (e.g., the goblins had a tactical advantage, the party was low on resources, or special conditions made the fight harder), they could consider increasing the XP reward slightly. Conversely, if the fight was unusually easy, they could reduce the XP awarded.

In this case, we'll assume the encounter was straightforward and doesn't require adjustment.

### Final XP Allocation

- **Fighter**: 75 XP
- **Cleric**: 75 XP
- **Rogue**: 75 XP
- **Wizard**: 75 XP

Each character gains **75 XP** from the encounter with the goblins.

### Recap of the DM’s Steps:
1. **Identify the monsters** in the encounter and their Challenge Rating (CR).
2. **Check the XP Award Table** to find the XP for a monster of that CR based on the party’s level.
3. **Multiply** the XP per monster by the number of monsters.
4. **Divide the total XP equally** among all party members.
5. Optionally, **adjust** XP if necessary for difficulty or other factors.

This method ensures that XP is fairly distributed and reflects the challenge level of the encounter.

To make the XP computation straightforward for the Dungeon Master (DM), the necessary data can be organized into a clear, concise format using tables. Here’s how the data would look, covering the key elements needed for the DM to perform the computation:

### 1. **Party Information**
| Character  | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Fighter    | 3     |
| Cleric     | 3     |
| Rogue      | 3     |
| Wizard     | 3     |

- **Average Party Level**: 3

### 2. **Monster Information**
| Monster   | CR (Challenge Rating) | XP per Monster (for Level 3 Party) | Number of Monsters | Total XP for Monsters |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Goblin    | 1/4                    | 75 XP                              | 4                  | 300 XP                |

### 3. **Experience Distribution**
- **Total XP for the encounter**: 300 XP
- **Number of characters in the party**: 4

| Character  | XP Earned |
|------------|-----------|
| Fighter    | 75 XP     |
| Cleric     | 75 XP     |
| Rogue      | 75 XP     |
| Wizard     | 75 XP     |

### Recap of Data for DM:
- **Party**: Four 3rd-level characters (Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard).
- **Encounter**: 4 goblins, each with **CR 1/4**.
- **XP per goblin**: 75 XP (from the XP Award Table for a 3rd-level party).
- **Total XP**: 300 XP for the encounter.
- **XP per character**: 300 XP ÷ 4 = 75 XP per character.

This table layout provides all the key information needed for the DM to compute XP quickly and efficiently.

Let’s break down an example with a more complicated encounter involving a party of four 3rd-level characters (Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard) against **2 Zombies**, **2 Ghouls**, and **1 Wraith**. Here's how the DM would calculate the XP for this more complex encounter.

### Step-by-Step Procedure for Computing XP:

1. **Identify the monsters and their Challenge Ratings (CR)**.
2. **Use the XP Award Table** to determine the XP for each monster based on the party's average level (which is 3).
3. **Multiply the XP** for each type of monster by the number of that type encountered.
4. **Add up the total XP** from all monsters in the encounter.
5. **Divide the total XP equally** among the party members.

---

### 1. **Party Information**
| Character  | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Fighter    | 3     |
| Cleric     | 3     |
| Rogue      | 3     |
| Wizard     | 3     |

- **Average Party Level**: 3

---

### 2. **Monster Information and XP Calculation**

To determine the XP each monster type is worth, we use the **XP Award Table** for a 3rd-level party.

| Monster   | CR (Challenge Rating) | XP per Monster (for Level 3 Party) | Number of Monsters | Total XP for Monsters |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Zombie    | 1/2                    | 150 XP                             | 2                  | 300 XP                |
| Ghoul     | 1                      | 300 XP                             | 2                  | 600 XP                |
| Wraith    | 5                      | 1,800 XP                           | 1                  | 1,800 XP              |

- **Zombie (CR 1/2)**: Each zombie is worth **150 XP** for a 3rd-level party. Since there are 2 zombies, the total XP for the zombies is:
  - **150 XP × 2 = 300 XP**.
  
- **Ghoul (CR 1)**: Each ghoul is worth **300 XP** for a 3rd-level party. Since there are 2 ghouls, the total XP for the ghouls is:
  - **300 XP × 2 = 600 XP**.
  
- **Wraith (CR 5)**: The wraith is more challenging, so it awards **1,800 XP** for a 3rd-level party. Since there is only 1 wraith, the total XP for the wraith is:
  - **1,800 XP × 1 = 1,800 XP**.

### 3. **Total XP for the Encounter**
- The total XP for the entire encounter (2 Zombies, 2 Ghouls, 1 Wraith) is the sum of XP from each group of monsters:
  - **Total XP = 300 XP (Zombies) + 600 XP (Ghouls) + 1,800 XP (Wraith)**.
  - **Total XP = 2,700 XP**.

---

### 4. **XP Distribution Among the Party**
- The total XP earned from the encounter (2,700 XP) is **divided equally** among the four party members.
- **2,700 XP total** ÷ **4 party members** = **675 XP per character**.

### 5. **Final XP Allocation Table**

| Character  | XP Earned |
|------------|-----------|
| Fighter    | 675 XP    |
| Cleric     | 675 XP    |
| Rogue      | 675 XP    |
| Wizard     | 675 XP    |

---

### Summary of the Procedure:
1. **Identify Monsters**: 2 Zombies, 2 Ghouls, 1 Wraith.
2. **Check CRs and XP**: Use the **XP Award Table** for a 3rd-level party to find the XP per monster.
3. **Calculate XP for each group**: 
   - Zombies (CR 1/2) = 150 XP each, total 300 XP.
   - Ghouls (CR 1) = 300 XP each, total 600 XP.
   - Wraith (CR 5) = 1,800 XP.
4. **Sum the XP**: Total for all monsters = 2,700 XP.
5. **Divide the XP equally**: Each party member earns **675 XP**.

This example demonstrates how the XP calculation process becomes slightly more complex with multiple types of enemies, but it follows the same basic steps. The Wraith, being significantly more challenging, contributes the most XP to the encounter, while the zombies and ghouls provide moderate rewards.

In this more complicated scenario, where the **Fighter** and **Cleric** enter one round earlier and defeat the zombies before the rest of the party (Rogue and Wizard) enter and join the fight with the ghouls and the wraith, the DM needs to handle XP distribution a bit differently. The XP for the encounter would now need to be divided among participants based on which monsters they fought. Let’s break this down.

### Key Differences in XP Allocation:
- **Zombies**: Only the **Fighter** and **Cleric** participated in defeating the zombies, so only they will earn XP for those kills.
- **Ghouls and Wraith**: All four party members participate in defeating the ghouls and the wraith, so XP for these monsters is divided among all four members.

### Step-by-Step XP Computation

#### 1. **Party Information**

| Character  | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Fighter    | 3     |
| Cleric     | 3     |
| Rogue      | 3     |
| Wizard     | 3     |

- **Average Party Level**: 3

---

#### 2. **Monster Information and XP Calculation**

Let’s break down the XP calculation by separating which monsters are defeated by which party members.

##### **Monsters Defeated by Fighter and Cleric**:
- **2 Zombies** (CR 1/2) = **150 XP each** for a 3rd-level party.
  - **Total XP for zombies**: 150 XP × 2 = **300 XP**.
  - Since only the Fighter and Cleric were involved in dispatching the zombies, this **300 XP** will be **split between the Fighter and Cleric**.

##### **Monsters Defeated by the Entire Party**:
- **2 Ghouls** (CR 1) = **300 XP each** for a 3rd-level party.
  - **Total XP for ghouls**: 300 XP × 2 = **600 XP**.
  
- **1 Wraith** (CR 5) = **1,800 XP** for a 3rd-level party.
  - **Total XP for wraith**: 1,800 XP.

The XP for the ghouls and the wraith (600 + 1,800 = **2,400 XP**) will be **divided among all four party members** (Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard).

---

#### 3. **Distribute XP Based on Participation**

##### **XP for Zombies** (Fighter and Cleric only):
- **300 XP** total ÷ **2 characters (Fighter, Cleric)** = **150 XP each** for the Fighter and Cleric.

##### **XP for Ghouls and Wraith** (All four party members):
- **2,400 XP** total ÷ **4 characters** = **600 XP each** for Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard.

---

### 4. **Final XP Allocation Table**

Here’s how the total XP is allocated based on participation in different parts of the encounter:

| Character  | XP for Zombies | XP for Ghouls & Wraith | **Total XP** |
|------------|----------------|------------------------|--------------|
| Fighter    | 150 XP         | 600 XP                 | **750 XP**   |
| Cleric     | 150 XP         | 600 XP                 | **750 XP**   |
| Rogue      | 0 XP           | 600 XP                 | **600 XP**   |
| Wizard     | 0 XP           | 600 XP                 | **600 XP**   |

---

### Summary of the Process:
1. **Identify the monsters** involved and their Challenge Ratings (CR).
2. **Determine who participated in each part** of the encounter:
   - Fighter and Cleric fought the zombies.
   - Fighter, Cleric, Rogue, and Wizard fought the ghouls and the wraith.
3. **Calculate the XP for each monster type** using the XP Award Table for a 3rd-level party.
4. **Allocate XP based on participation**:
   - Fighter and Cleric split the XP for the zombies.
   - All four party members split the XP for the ghouls and the wraith.
5. **Total XP for each party member**: Fighter and Cleric earn more XP because they participated in both parts of the battle, while Rogue and Wizard only participated in the latter part.

This approach ensures that XP is distributed fairly based on who was involved in defeating which monsters, while still following the general rules of XP allocation in D&D 3.5e.

In this more complex scenario, we have two additional complications:
1. **The Rogue (Thief) is paralyzed** by one of the ghouls early in the encounter and does not contribute to the combat beyond the initial engagement.
2. **The Wraith escapes** the combat before being defeated, so the party doesn’t receive XP for the wraith.

Given these new circumstances, the DM will need to adjust XP calculations to reflect the Rogue's non-participation and the fact that the Wraith didn’t die, so no XP is awarded for it.

### Revised Step-by-Step XP Computation

#### 1. **Party Information**
The party still consists of four 3rd-level characters.

| Character  | Level |
|------------|-------|
| Fighter    | 3     |
| Cleric     | 3     |
| Rogue      | 3     |
| Wizard     | 3     |

---

#### 2. **Revised Monster Information and XP Calculation**
We now need to modify the XP awarded based on which monsters were defeated and which party members actively participated.

##### **Monsters Defeated by Fighter and Cleric**:
- **2 Zombies** (CR 1/2) = **150 XP each** for a 3rd-level party.
  - **Total XP for zombies**: 150 XP × 2 = **300 XP**.
  - Since only the Fighter and Cleric fought the zombies, this **300 XP** will be **split between the Fighter and Cleric**.

##### **Monsters Defeated by Fighter, Cleric, and Wizard (Excluding Rogue)**:
- **2 Ghouls** (CR 1) = **300 XP each** for a 3rd-level party.
  - **Total XP for ghouls**: 300 XP × 2 = **600 XP**.
  - Since the **Rogue was paralyzed** and could not participate in the battle with the ghouls, the XP from defeating the ghouls will be **split among the Fighter, Cleric, and Wizard**.

##### **The Wraith Escapes**:
- The **Wraith (CR 5)** was not defeated, so **no XP** is awarded for it.
  - The wraith's **1,800 XP** that would have been earned is **not counted**.

---

#### 3. **Distribute XP Based on Participation**

##### **XP for Zombies** (Fighter and Cleric only):
- **300 XP** total ÷ **2 characters (Fighter, Cleric)** = **150 XP each** for the Fighter and Cleric.

##### **XP for Ghouls** (Fighter, Cleric, and Wizard only):
- **600 XP** total ÷ **3 characters (Fighter, Cleric, Wizard)** = **200 XP each** for Fighter, Cleric, and Wizard.

---

### 4. **Final XP Allocation Table**

Given the adjusted participation and the Wraith escaping, here’s the revised XP allocation:

| Character  | XP for Zombies | XP for Ghouls | **Total XP** |
|------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Fighter    | 150 XP         | 200 XP        | **350 XP**   |
| Cleric     | 150 XP         | 200 XP        | **350 XP**   |
| Rogue      | 0 XP           | 0 XP          | **0 XP**     |
| Wizard     | 0 XP           | 200 XP        | **200 XP**   |

---

### Explanation of the Adjustments:

1. **Fighter and Cleric**: 
   - They participated in the entire combat, fighting both the zombies and the ghouls. As a result, they earn XP for both encounters: **150 XP for the zombies** and **200 XP for the ghouls**, for a total of **350 XP** each.
   
2. **Wizard**: 
   - The Wizard only fought the ghouls (since the Wizard entered after the zombies were defeated). Therefore, the Wizard earns **200 XP** for defeating the ghouls.

3. **Rogue (Thief)**:
   - The Rogue was **paralyzed immediately by the ghouls** and did not participate in defeating any of the monsters. As a result, the Rogue earns **0 XP** for this encounter.

4. **Wraith**: 
   - Since the **Wraith escaped**, **no XP** is awarded for it. This also simplifies the distribution because there’s no need to account for that large chunk of XP (1,800 XP) that the party would have received had they defeated the Wraith.

---

### Summary of the Revised Procedure:
1. **Determine Participation**: Identify which party members contributed to defeating which monsters:
   - Fighter and Cleric fought both zombies and ghouls.
   - Wizard fought only ghouls.
   - Rogue was paralyzed and didn't contribute.
2. **No XP for Wraith**: Since the Wraith escaped, **no XP** is awarded for it.
3. **Divide XP by participation**:
   - Fighter and Cleric get XP for both zombies and ghouls.
   - Wizard gets XP only for the ghouls.
   - Rogue gets no XP, having been incapacitated.
4. **Final XP**: Allocate XP based on who was involved in each battle.

This method ensures that XP is distributed fairly, considering both participation and the fact that not all monsters were defeated.
