# How would a DM determine treasure for a dungeon?

A Dungeon Master (DM) in Dungeons & Dragons determines treasure for a dungeon based on a combination of factors, including the challenge level of the encounters, the type of treasure, and the overall adventure or campaign context. The process can be approached in a few different ways depending on the edition of the game being played, the DM's preference for randomness or planned rewards, and the narrative of the campaign.

Here is a general step-by-step guide to how a DM might determine treasure for a dungeon:

### 1. **Determine Encounter Levels and Treasure Value**
   The amount and quality of treasure are often tied to the **Challenge Rating (CR)** of the encounters in the dungeon and the level of the player characters (PCs). Higher-level encounters tend to yield better rewards.

   - **Challenge Rating (CR)**: Each encounter has a CR, which represents the difficulty level of the encounter. Many treasure tables are tied to the CR of the enemies or the overall difficulty of the dungeon.
   - **Treasure per Encounter**: Depending on the encounter’s CR, you can reference official tables (such as in the Dungeon Master’s Guide) to determine how much gold, magic items, or other rewards the players can earn.

   For example, in **D&D 5e**, the Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG) provides treasure tables based on CRs:
   - CR 0-4: Small amounts of gold or common magic items.
   - CR 5-10: Larger gold rewards, with more frequent magic items.
   - CR 11+: High-value treasure, rare or very rare magic items.

### 2. **Choose or Roll for Treasure Type**
   The DM decides the types of treasure to place in the dungeon. Treasure can consist of **coins**, **gems**, **art objects**, **mundane equipment**, and **magic items**. 

   The treasure might be determined randomly using a treasure table (like the tables in the Dungeon Master's Guide) or by the DM planning specific rewards. 

   Common treasure types include:
   - **Coins**: Gold pieces (gp), silver pieces (sp), copper pieces (cp), and sometimes platinum (pp). Higher-level encounters yield more valuable coins.
   - **Gems and Art Objects**: More valuable than coins and can be role-played as beautiful or interesting items.
   - **Magic Items**: Magic items are among the most exciting rewards for players and can range from simple potions to powerful weapons and armor.

   **Example**: In **D&D 5e**, a CR 1-4 encounter might yield:
   - 1d6 x 100 copper pieces
   - 1d6 x 10 silver pieces
   - 1d6 gold pieces
   - A chance for a **common magic item**, like a potion of healing.

### 3. **Roll or Select Specific Magic Items**
   If the dungeon’s treasure includes magic items, the DM can roll randomly or select items that fit the narrative of the dungeon or the campaign.

   - **Random Magic Items**: Use the tables in the DMG or other rulebooks. Items are categorized by rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary.
   - **Curated Magic Items**: A DM may hand-pick magic items to reward the players for specific milestones or to balance the power level in the party.

   **Example**: For a CR 5-10 encounter, a DM might randomly roll or select from the **Magic Item Table B** (DMG p. 144) for an **Uncommon Magic Item**, like a **Bag of Holding** or a **+1 weapon**.

### 4. **Distribute Treasure Throughout the Dungeon**
   Rather than giving out all the treasure in one spot, the DM can spread it across the dungeon. Some treasure might be found in:
   - **Hidden rooms** or **secret compartments**.
   - **Loot from defeated enemies**.
   - **Treasure chests** or **ancient tombs**.
   - **Cursed or trapped treasure**, which adds an extra layer of challenge.

   This creates a more immersive and dynamic experience for the players as they explore the dungeon.

### 5. **Match Treasure to the Dungeon’s Story**
   The DM should also consider the dungeon's narrative and theme when determining treasure. For example:
   - A **dwarven mine** might contain precious metals and gems.
   - An **ancient wizard’s tower** could hold rare magical tomes or arcane items.
   - An **undead-infested crypt** might contain cursed items or necromantic artifacts.

### 6. **Adjust for Campaign Balance**
   The DM should keep in mind the balance of the campaign. Overloading the party with powerful magic items too early can break the game's balance, while being too stingy with treasure might leave the players frustrated.

   The DM can use the guidelines in the DMG or similar resources to help gauge appropriate amounts of treasure for a party’s level and the overall tone of the campaign.

### 7. **Optional: Personalize Treasure for the Players**
   A DM can make the treasure more exciting and personal by including items that are meaningful to the characters. For example:
   - A fighter might find an heirloom weapon.
   - A rogue might uncover a legendary set of thieves' tools.
   - A wizard could discover a rare spellbook.

   By doing this, the DM adds emotional or narrative weight to the treasure, making it more memorable.

### Example Process for a CR 5 Dungeon:
Let’s say a DM is designing a treasure hoard for a CR 5 dungeon.

1. **Coins**: Based on the DMG treasure table for CR 5, the DM might roll:
   - 2d6 x 100 gold pieces = 700 gp.
   - 1d6 x 10 platinum pieces = 30 pp.

2. **Gems/Art Objects**: The DM might add:
   - 1d6 gems worth 50 gp each.
   - 1d4 art objects worth 250 gp each.

3. **Magic Items**: The DM can roll on Magic Item Table B and get:
   - A **+1 weapon** (for the fighter).
   - A **Potion of Greater Healing**.
   - A **Cloak of Protection** (perfect for a rogue or wizard).

4. **Narrative**: The DM places these treasures in various places:
   - Some of the coins and gems are in a hidden chest in the final room.
   - The +1 weapon is held by a powerful enemy, and the players find it after defeating them.
   - The Cloak of Protection is located in a secret room with traps.

### Additional Resources:
- **Treasure Tables** in the **Dungeon Master's Guide** (5e: p. 133-149) or equivalent guides from other editions.
- **Adventure-specific tables** in pre-written modules, which often include custom treasure tied to the story.
- **Online tools**: There are many random treasure generators available online that can automate the rolling process for treasure.

By considering the difficulty of encounters, treasure type, and the story of the dungeon, a DM can create a satisfying and balanced treasure experience for the players.
