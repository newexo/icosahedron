# Secrets directory

This directory contains secrets used by the Icosahedron library in testing, development and production. Secrets are 
sensitive information that should not be shared with others. This directory is included in the `.gitignore` file, so
that they will not accidentally be committed to the repository.

If there is a `.env`, look for that by default in this directory.
