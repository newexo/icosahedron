  "name": "Spell Sniper",
  "prerequisites": "Ability to cast at least one spell",
  "benefit": "You have mastered ranged spells and gained the following benefits:\n- When you cast a spell that requires an attack roll, the spell's range is doubled.\n- Your ranged spell attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.\n- You learn one cantrip that requires an attack roll. Choose the cantrip from any spellcasting class; your spellcasting ability for this cantrip depends on the class you selected.",
  "description": "The Spell Sniper feat enhances a character's spellcasting abilities and precision. It allows them to extend the range of their ranged spells, ignore cover when making spell attacks, and learn an additional attack roll-based cantrip from any spellcasting class.",
  "usage": "This feat's benefits apply whenever you cast a spell that requires an attack roll. The extended range and cover-ignoring effects are automatically in effect. To learn a new cantrip, consult the spellcasting rules for the chosen cantrip's spellcasting ability and other relevant details.",
  "normal_use": "Without the Spell Sniper feat, the character's ranged spells have their regular range and do not gain the benefits of extended range or cover-ignoring effects. The character's cantrip choices would follow the usual rules of their selected spellcasting class, without the additional attack roll-based cantrip granted by the feat."
