# Discussion

## Prompts to prime the pump

- Tell me about dice used in the D20 system.
- Describe dice rolling mechanics in D20.
- What notation is used to describe dice rolls in D20?

## Prompts to generate python code

- Write a python class to roll dice according to D20 rules.
- Write a json object representing the arguments for D20Roller.roll function.
- Write a function to roll D20Roller given a json object.
- Create a class to encapsulate the json object representing a D20Roller roll.
- Write a unit test for D20Roller.
- Write a unit test for D20Roll.

## Branch for generated raw results

Raw results are in branch [generated/dice_roller](https://github.com/newexo/icosahedron/tree/generated/dice_roller).

## Steps to make code actually work

Recorded steps to make code actually work in commit history of branch [refactor/dice_roller](https://github.com/newexo/icosahedron/tree/refactor/dice_roller).

1. First delete extra code from copy and paste and fix the imports so that tests run. After this, two test runs, but 
does not pass fail because of similar error `missing 1 required positional argument: 'dice_type'`.
2. Request fix for unit tests and a refactor for D20Roll and D20Roller. Managed to improve D20Roll and D20Roller, but 
the tests remained problematic. Eventually decided to accept parts the proposed tests.

## Final refactor

1. Fixed tests by hand.
2. Added functions to and from dict to D20Roller.

## Documentation comments

Fed back the resulting rewrite of `dice.py` into ChatGPT and requested python doc comments.
